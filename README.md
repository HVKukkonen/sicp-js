This repo consists of my solutions for the exercises in the book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs â€” JavaScript Edition](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/index). All solutions presented are written by me without assistance. I've read the book as personal development without attending any course.

Please, note that the solutions presented are written (relaxedly) following the minimalistic style presented in the source material. 
Thus, **the solutions should not be considered as representing my personal coding style or preferred notation**.
