> 4.14 Eva Lu Ator and Louis Reasoner are each experimenting with the metacircular evaluator. Eva types in the definition of map, and runs some test programs that use it. They work fine. Louis, in contrast, has installed the system version of map as a primitive for the metacircular evaluator. When he tries it, things go terribly wrong. Explain why Louis's map fails even though Eva's works.

So the exercise asks why cannot we just install any of the built-in functions of JS to be primitives in our evaluator implementation. The reason is, of course, the difference in the representations our evaluator program and the actual vanilla JS use for the program environment and other internals. Using the map by Louis would result in the whole program environment getting passed as an argument to the built-in JS map function.
